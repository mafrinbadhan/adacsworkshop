# Adacs best coding practice workshop
This is the example project that we have been working on in the ADACS 2023 inaugural carpenting workshop.
Note that Mahmuda, the person who wrote this specific version, is in the room physically.

Most participants are here in person. Some are online.

Goal of the project:

Stars should have randomized sky positions around the Andromeda galaxy
Positions should fall within 1 degree of the central location
Each star should have a unique ID
The star ID and position should be saved in a csv file to be analyzed by other programs

The code as it is was downloaded from the workshop documentation (sky_sim.py).
